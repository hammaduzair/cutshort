Hey! just a little overview of the project
routes.js -> contains routes of all the modules in the project
modules -> contains all separate modules ex(todo, users, posts)
core -> contains core functions,in our case redis
models -> contains all the models
helpers -> contains common helpers functions throughout the project
config.js -> contains config values

Some features may be missing due to lack of time and my availability this week due to some strict deadlines in my current office projects. 
Also I have added some features only in certain apis, again due to limited time (ex. searching is available only in todos), also couldn't do code refactoring (object destructuring and other stuff) in some files.
